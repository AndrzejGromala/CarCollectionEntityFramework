This is an ASP.NET MVC application build using Entity Framework and DataBase First model. The application allows to enter a car details and save it in a SQL DataBase. It also allows editing, adding new and deleting cars from the DataBase.
This is work in progress and there will be other functionality added like validation of input fields.
